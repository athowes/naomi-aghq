#' I've got the fit_adam working with AGHQ k = 1, and know how to sample from the
#' Laplace marginals by using spline interpolation then the inverse CDF sampling
#' method. The next step is simply to bring this together and package it up into
#' a function sample_adam() which outputs in the same format as sample_aghq() say.

#' TODO
