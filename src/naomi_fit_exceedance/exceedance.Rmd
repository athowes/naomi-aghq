  **Background**  We have run the simplified Naomi model using a range of inference methods: `TMB`, `aghq`, `adam` and `tmbstan`.
  
  **Task** In this report, we compare the accuracy of the posterior distributions obtained from these inference methods using exceedance probabilities.
---

# Background

We compare the inference results from `TMB`, `aghq`, `adam`, and `tmbstan`.
Import these inference results as follows:

```{r}
tmb <- readRDS("depends/tmb.rds")
aghq <- readRDS("depends/aghq.rds")
adam <- readRDS("depends/adam.rds")
tmbstan <- readRDS("depends/tmbstan.rds")
```
