abstract: |
  | Naomi is a spatial evidence synthesis model used to produce district-level HIV epidemic indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple outcomes of interest, including HIV prevalence, HIV incidence and antiretroviral therapy treatment coverage are jointly modelled using both household survey data and routinely reported health system data. We propose a new inference method which combines the simplified integrated nested Laplace approximation approach of @wood2020simplified with adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to enable fast and accurate inference for Naomi and other extended latent Gaussian models. Using data from Malawi, our method provides substantially more accurate inferences than the empirical Bayes Gaussian approximation approach used currently, and is comparable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the No-U-Turn sampler. By extending the \texttt{aghq} \textsc{R} package we facilitate flexible and easy use of our method when provided a \texttt{TMB} C++ template for the model's log-posterior.

# Introduction

Mounting an effective public health response to the HIV epidemic requires accurate, timely and sufficiently fine-scale estimates of HIV indicators.
No single data source is sufficient to base these estimates on.
Although nationally-representative household surveys are the most reliable data source, in most countries they only occur infrequently.
Other data sources, such as routine health surveillance of antenatal care clinics, are more timely but from a biased sample of the population.
To remedy these challenges, the Naomi small-area estimation model [@eaton2021naomi] synthesises data from multiple sources to estimate HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, and coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ART) at a district-level.
Software (\url{https://naomi.unaids.org}) has been developed for Naomi, which allows countries to input their data and generate estimates in a yearly process supported by UNAIDS.

The model is complex and presents a challenging inference problem.
Any approach must be fast enough to run in production by country teams, ruling out prohibitively slow Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
Currently, inference is currently conducted using an empirical Bayes approach, with a Gaussian approximation to the latent field, via the Template Model Builder (`TMB`) \textsf{R} package [@kristensen2016tmb].
Owing to its speed and flexibility, `TMB` is more broadly becoming a popular package in spatial statistics [@osgoodzimmerman2021statistical].
In `TMB`, inference is based on optimisation of a C++ template function, with the option available to use a Laplace approximation to integrate out any subset of the function arguments.
Taking inspiration from the AD Model Builder (ADMB) package [@fournier2012ad], `TMB` uses automatic differentiation [@baydin2017automatic] to calculate the derivatives required for numerical optimisation routines and the Laplace approximation.
Although this approach has favorable computational properties, we have found the inferences generated for the Naomi model to sometimes be inaccurate.
To obtain fast, accruate inferences for the Naomi model we develop a new inference methodology which combines the simplified integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach of @wood2020simplified with adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature (AGHQ).

INLA [@rue2009approximate] is an approach to approximate Bayesian inference based on nested Laplace approximations and numerical quadrature, and implemented in the `R-INLA` \textsc{R} package.
The central innovation is a way to approximate accurate latent field posterior marginals without explicitly computing the full Laplace approximation for each element.
Simplified INLA [@wood2020simplified] extends INLA by relaxing the sparsity assumptions on the latent field required for this approximation to be accurate.
Doing so facilitates inference for extended latent Gaussian models (ELGMs) [@stringer2022fast], which build on latent Gaussian models (LGMs) by allowing each element of the linear predictor $\mu_i$ to depend on any subset of elements from the latent field.

AGHQ is a quadrature rule based on the theory of polynomial interpolation which adapts to the integrand based on the Hessian at the mode.
@bilodeau2021stochastic provide theoretical results.
The method is implementing in the `aghq` \textsf{R} package [@stringer2021implementing].

# The Naomi model

@eaton2019joint specify a joint model linking small-area estimation models of HIV prevalence from household surveys, HIV prevalence from antenatal care clinics, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage from routine health data collection.
This model forms the basis of the Naomi small-area estimation model, described fully in @eaton2021naomi. 
Modelling data from multiple sources concurrently is attractive as it increases statistical power, mitigates the biases of any single source, and prompts investigation into any data conflicts.
The model is comprised of three components, described as follows.

## Household survey component

Consider a country partitioned into $n$ areas indexed by $i$.
Suppose a simple random household survey of $m^\text{HS}_i$ people is conducted in each area, and $y^\text{HS}_i$ HIV positive cases are observed.
Cases may be modelled using a binomial logistic regression model
\begin{align}
y^\text{HS}_i &\sim \text{Bin}(m^\text{HS}_i, \rho^\text{HS}_i), \\
\text{logit}(\rho^\text{HS}_i) &\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_\phi, \sigma_\phi^2),
\end{align}
where HIV prevalence $\rho^\text{HS}_i$ is modelled by a Gaussian with mean $\beta_\phi$ and standard deviation $\sigma_\phi$.

## ANC component

Routinely collected data from pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics (ANCs) is another important source of information about the HIV epidemic.
Suppose that of $m^\text{ANC}_i$ women attending ANC, $y^\text{ANC}_i$ are HIV positive.
Then an analogous binomial logistic regression model
\begin{align}
y^\text{ANC}_i &\sim \text{Bin}(m^\text{ANC}_i, \rho^\text{ANC}_i), \\
\text{logit}(\rho^\text{ANC}_i) &= \text{logit}(\rho^\text{HS}_i) + b_i, \\
b_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_b, \sigma_b^2),
\end{align}
may be used to describe HIV prevalence amongst the sub-population of women attending ANCs.
Reflecting the fact that prevalence in ANCs is related but importantly different to prevalence in the general population, bias terms $b_i$ are used to offset ANC prevalence from HIV prevalence on the logit scale.

## ART component

The number of people receiving treatment at district health facilities $A_i$ provides further information about HIV prevalence.
Districts with high prevalence are likely to have a greater number of people receiving treatment, and vice versa.
ART coverage, defined to be the proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) currently on ART on district $i$, is given by $\alpha_i = A_i / \rho^\text{HS}_i N_i$, where $N_i$ is the total population of district $i$ and assumed to be constant.
As such, ART coverage may also be modelled using a binomial logistic regression model
\begin{align}
A_i &\sim \text{Bin}(N_i, \rho^\text{HS}_i \alpha_i), \\
\text{logit}(\alpha_i) &\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_\alpha, \sigma_\alpha^2),
\end{align}
where the proportion of people receiving ART is $\rho^\text{HS}_i \alpha_i$.
Here we assume no travel between districts to receive treatment.

## Joint model

Let $\y = (\y^\text{HS}, \y^\text{ANC}, \bm{A})$ be the complete response vector.
In this section, we would like to set-up notation for the joint model, helping to show that it isn't a latent Gaussian model, but is an extended latent Gaussian model.
When introducing LGM and ELGM below, we may refer back to this model as example.
For example, we can note that each of the components individually might be latent Gaussian (perhaps for the ART component it depends if you consider $\rho^\text{HS}_i$ to be fixed) but when combined they are no longer.

# Fast inference methods

## Integrated nested Laplace approximation\label{sec:inla}

INLA is designed for use with latent Gaussian models (LGMs) of the form
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\text{(Observations)}     &        y_i &\sim p(y_i \, | \, x_i, \btheta), \quad i = 1, \ldots, n, \label{eq:data} \\
&\text{(Latent field)}     &        \x &\sim \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q}(\btheta)^{-1}), \label{eq:process} \\
&\text{(Parameters)}       & \qquad \btheta &\sim p(\btheta), \label{eq:parameters}
\end{alignat}
where $\text{dim}(\y) = \text{dim}(\x) = n$ and $\text{dim}(\btheta) = m$, and $m < n$.
For such models, the joint posterior of $(\x, \btheta)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  p(\x, \btheta \, | \, \y) 
  \propto p(\btheta) |\mathbf{Q}(\btheta)|^{n/2} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \x^\top \mathbf{Q}(\btheta) \x + \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \, | \, x_i, \btheta) \right). \label{eq:lgmjointposterior}
\end{equation}
Rather than approximating the above full posterior, the INLA method instead approximates the posterior marginals of each latent random variable $x_i$ and parameter $\theta_j$ given by
\begin{align}
  p(x_i \, | \, \y) &= \int p(x_i, \btheta \, | \, \y) \text{d} \btheta = \int p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y) p(\btheta \, | \, \y) \text{d}\btheta, \quad i = 1, \dots, n, \label{eq:inla1} \\
  p(\theta_j \, | \, \y) &= \int p(\btheta \, | \, \y) \text{d}\btheta_{-j} \quad j = 1, \ldots, m. \label{eq:inla2}
\end{align}
An approximation is made to each of the two quantities, $p(\btheta \, | \, \y)$ and $p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y)$, nested inside the above integrals: (i) $p(\btheta \, | \, \y) \approx \tilde p(\btheta \, | \, \y)$ and (ii) $p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y) \approx \tilde p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y)$.
We discuss these two approximations in turn below.

### Approximation (i) \label{sec:approxi}

The posterior marginal of the parameters $p(\btheta \, | \, \y)$ appears in both Equations \eqref{eq:inla1} and \eqref{eq:inla2}.
This distribution is approximated by $\tilde p(\btheta \, | \, \y)$ and represented by a set of $K$ integration points $\{ \btheta^{(k)} \}$ and area-weights $\{ \Delta^{(k)} \}$.
The first step is to rewrite $p(\btheta \, | \, \y)$ as
\begin{equation}
  p(\btheta \, | \, \y) 
  = \frac{p(\x, \btheta \, | \, \y)}{p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)}
  \propto \frac{p(\y, \x, \btheta)}{p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)}. \label{eq:hyperpost}
\end{equation}
Approximation (i) then uses a Gaussian approximation to the denominator given by
\begin{equation}
p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) \approx p_G(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) \triangleq \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta), \hat{\mathbf{Q}}(\btheta)^{-1}). \label{eq:gaussianx}
\end{equation}
This approximation is accurate as the Gaussian prior on the latent field $\x$ makes the posterior distribution, given by
\begin{equation}
p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) \propto
\exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \x^\top \mathbf{Q}(\btheta) \x + \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \, | \, x_i, \btheta) \right),
\end{equation}
close to being Gaussian because $\y$ tends not to be strongly informative and the observation distribution $p(\y \, | \, \x, \btheta)$ is usually well-behaved [@blangiardo2015spatial].
<!-- If $\y$ is uninformative about $\x$ then how can we hope for useful inference? Perhaps what the author (Marta) meant is that the Gaussian distribution is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the updates made by $\y$. -->
As $p(\btheta \, | \, \y)$ does not depend on $\x$, any value may be chosen to evaluate the right hand side of Equation \ref{eq:hyperpost}.
Taking $\x = \hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta)$, the value where the Gaussian approximation is most accurate, gives the final approximation as
\begin{equation}
\tilde p(\btheta \, | \, \y) \propto \frac{p(\y, \x, \btheta)}{p_G(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)} \Big\rvert_{\x = \hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta)} = \frac{p(\y, \hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta), \btheta)}{\det(\hat{\bm{Q}}(\btheta))^{1/2}}, \label{eq:hypermarginal}
\end{equation}
where the equality is because $p_G(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)$ is evaluated at its mode $\hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta)$.

### Approximation (ii)

We now move on to the approximation $p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y) \approx \tilde p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y)$.
Having used used the Gaussian approximation $p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) \approx p_G(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)$ in Section \ref{sec:approxi} above, a natural approach, and that taken by [@rue2007approximate], is to marginalise this distribution directly to obtain
\begin{equation}
\tilde p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y) = \mathcal{N}(x_i \, | \, \hat{\mu}_i(\btheta), 1 / \hat{q}_i(\btheta)),
\end{equation}
where the marginal mean $\hat{\mu}_i(\btheta)$ and precision $\hat{q}_i(\btheta)$ are recovered directly from the relevant entries of $\hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta)$ and $\hat{\bm{Q}}(\btheta)$ respectively.
However, although this approximation is fast, it tends not to be accurate, as it involves evaluating the Gaussian approximation away from its mode, so is generally not advised.
Instead, [@rue2009approximate] propose two methods, a Laplace approximation and a simplified version which is less computationally demanding.
The full Laplace approximation is
\begin{align}
  p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y) &= p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) \times \frac{1}{p(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)} \\
  &= \frac{p(\x, \btheta \, | \, \y)}{p(\btheta \, | \, \y)} \times \frac{1}{p(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)} \\
  &\propto \frac{p(\x, \btheta \, | \, \y)}{p(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)} \\
  &\approx \frac{p(\x, \btheta \, | \, \y)}{p_G(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)} \Big\rvert_{\x_{-i} = \hat{\bm{\mu}}_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)}
  = \tilde p_{LA}(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y), \label{eq:laplaceapproximation}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
p_G(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y) = \mathcal{N}(\x_{-i} \, | \, \hat{\bm{\mu}}_{-i}(x_i, \btheta), \hat{\bm{Q}}_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)),
\end{equation}
is the Gaussian approximation to $\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y$ and $\hat{\bm{\mu}}_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)$ is its modal configuration.\footnote{Note that $\hat{\bm{\mu}}(\btheta)$ is the mode of the Gaussian approximation to the full latent field given $\btheta$ and $\hat{\bm{\mu}}_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)$ is not the same as $\hat{\bm{\mu}}_{-i}(\btheta)$.}
The set of distributions $\{p(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)\}_{i = 1}^n$ are usually reasonably Gaussian so this approximation tends to work well.
However, the Gaussian approximation $p_G(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)$ must be recomputed for each value of $i$, which is often computationally prohibitive.
Therefore, two modifications to Equation \eqref{eq:laplaceapproximation} are proposed by [@rue2009approximate] to reduce the computational cost:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Avoiding having to find the mode via optimisation by using the approximation $\hat{\bm{\mu}}_{-i}(x_i, \btheta) \approx \mathbb{E}_{p_G(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)}(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i)$
\item
As only those $x_j$ close to $x_i$ should have an impact on the marginal of $x_i$, then by selecting some subset $R_i(\btheta)$ of nodes $j$ to impact $j$ the matrix which needs to be factorised can be reduced in dimension to be $| R_i(\btheta) | \times | R_i(\btheta) |$ rather than $n \times n$
\end{enumerate}
