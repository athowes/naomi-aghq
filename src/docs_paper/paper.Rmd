abstract: |
  | Naomi is a spatial evidence synthesis model used to produce district-level HIV epidemic indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple outcomes of interest, including HIV prevalence, HIV incidence and antiretroviral therapy treatment coverage are jointly modelled using both household survey data and routinely reported health system data. We propose a new inference method which combines the simplified integrated nested Laplace approximation approach of @wood2020simplified with adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to enable fast and accurate inference for Naomi and other extended latent Gaussian models. Using data from Malawi, our method provides substantially more accurate inferences than the empirical Bayes Gaussian approximation approach used currently, and is comparable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the No-U-Turn sampler. By extending the \texttt{aghq} \textsc{R} package we facilitate flexible and easy use of our method when provided a \texttt{TMB} \textsf{C++} template for the model's log-posterior.

# Introduction

Mounting an effective public health response to the HIV epidemic requires accurate, timely HIV indicator estimates at a sufficiently fine-scale resolution.
Producing these estimates is a challenging task, as all available data sources have shortcomings.
Nationally-representative household surveys are the most statistically reliable data source, but due to their high cost to run, in most countries they only occur infrequently.
Other data sources, such as routine health surveillance of antenatal care clinics, are more real-time but based on a biased sample of the population.
To meet these challenges, the Naomi small-area estimation model [@eaton2021naomi] synthesises data from multiple sources to estimate HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, and coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ART) at a district-level.
Software (\url{https://naomi.unaids.org}) has been developed for Naomi, which allows countries to input their data and generate estimates in a yearly process supported by UNAIDS.

The complexity of the model presents a difficult Bayesian inference problem.
Any inferential strategy must be fast, as well as easy to run in production by country teams, ruling out prohibitively slow Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches.
Inference is currently conducted using an empirical Bayes approach, with a Gaussian approximation to the latent field, via the Template Model Builder (`TMB`) \textsf{R} package [@kristensen2016tmb].
Owing to its speed and flexibility, `TMB` is gaining popularity spatial statistics [@osgoodzimmerman2021statistical].
Inference in `TMB` is based on optimisation of a \textsf{C++} template function, with the option available to use a Laplace approximation to integrate out any subset of the function arguments.
For the Naomi model, we use this option to integrate out the latent field parameters.
Taking inspiration from the AD Model Builder (ADMB) package [@fournier2012ad], `TMB` uses automatic differentiation [@baydin2017automatic] to calculate the derivatives required for numerical optimisation routines and the Laplace approximation.
Although this approach has favourable computational properties, we have found the inferences generated for the Naomi model to sometimes be inaccurate.

To obtain fast, accurate inferences for the Naomi model we develop a new inference methodology which combines the simplified integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach of @wood2020simplified with adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature (AGHQ).
INLA is an approach to approximate Bayesian inference based on nested Laplace approximations and numerical quadrature.
The central innovation of @rue2009approximate is a way to approximate accurate latent field posterior marginals without explicitly computing the full Laplace approximation for each element.
Simplified INLA [@wood2020simplified] extends INLA by relaxing the sparsity assumptions on the latent field required for this approximation to be accurate.
This extension facilitates inference for models like Naomi, which fall within the extended latent Gaussian model (ELGM) [@stringer2022fast] class, and were not previously amenable to inference with INLA.
ELGMs build on latent Gaussian models (LGMs) by allowing each element of the linear predictor to depend on any subset of elements from the latent field.
We combine simplified INLA with AGHQ, a quadrature rule based on the theory of polynomial interpolation which adapts to the integrand based on the Hessian at the mode.
Though no theory yet exists for the nested case, the first stochastic convergence results for adaptive quadrature rules were recently obtained by @bilodeau2021stochastic using AGHQ.
We implement our method as an extension of the `aghq` \textsf{R} package [@stringer2021implementing].
As `aghq` is designed to naturally interface with `TMB`, use of the method is easy when provided a \textsf{C++} user template for the log-posterior.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
In Section \ref{sec:naomi} we describe a modified version of the Naomi model that we consider.
Section \ref{sec:fastinferencemethods} outlines our approach to fast, accurate Bayesian inference using simplified INLA and AGHQ.
As a case-study, we fit the modified Naomi model on data from Malawi, and compare the accuracy of inferences in Section \ref{sec:naomi}.
In this section, we also demonstrating a Bayesian workflow.
Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusions} we discuss our conclusions, how our method might be used in other models, and directions for future research.

# A modified Naomi model\label{sec:naomi}

@eaton2021naomi specify a joint model linking small-area estimation models of HIV prevalence from household surveys, HIV prevalence from antenatal care clinics, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage from routine health data collection.
Modelling data from multiple sources concurrently is beneficial as it mitigates the limitations of any single source, increases statistical power and prompts investigation into data conflicts.

Let $x$ index district, $a$ index five-year age band, $s$ index sex and $t$ index time.
For each country, the full model is defined over three time points: $T_1$, the time of the most recent household survey with HIV testing; $T_2$, the current time period; and $T_3$, a short term projection period.
We consider a simplified version defined only at $T_1$, omiting all temporal projection.
In this section, we provide an overview of the modified model, highlighting the aspects which make it a challenge for existing inferential approaches.
Full mathematical details of this modified model, as well as a \textsf{C++} template for the log-posterior, are provided in the appendix.

## Household survey component

Consider a household survey occurring at $T_1$, and let $i$ index the coarsest district-age-sex division included in the model.
The data we observe may be aggregated over indices $i$, so we let $\mathcal{I}$ be a set of $i$ for which observations are reported.
Let $N_i$ be the population size, and consider the following three indicators: HIV prevalence $\rho_i \in [0, 1]$, ART coverage $\alpha_i \in [0, 1]$, and annual HIV incidence rate $\lambda_i > 0$.
We specify independent mixed effects models for HIV prevalence and ART coverage in the general population on the logit scale such that
\begin{align*}
\text{logit}(\rho_i) &= \eta^\rho_i, \\
\text{logit}(\alpha_i) &= \eta^\alpha_i,
\end{align*}
for certain choice of linear predictors $\eta^\rho_i$ and $\eta^\alpha_i$.
For the HIV incidence rate we use a mixed effects model on the log scale
$$
\log(\lambda_i) = \eta^\lambda_i(\{\rho_i, \alpha_i\}_{i \in \mathcal{I}}),
$$
where the linear predictor depends on $\{\rho_i, \alpha_i\}_{i \in \mathcal{I}}$.

Let $\kappa_i$ be the proportion recently infected among HIV positive persons.
For each set of observed strata indices $\mathcal{I}$, we calculate the weighted observations $\hat \theta_\mathcal{I}$ for $\theta \in \{\rho, \alpha, \kappa\}$ with respective Kish effective sample sizes 
$$
M^{\hat \theta}_\mathcal{I} = \frac{\left(\sum_j w_j\right)^2}{\sum_j w_j^2},
$$
where $j$ index individuals in all strata $i \in \mathcal{I}$, with corresponding survey weights $w_j$.
The observed number of indicator cases is then
$$
Y^{\hat \theta}_{\mathcal{I}} = M^{\hat \theta}_{\mathcal{I}} \cdot \hat \theta_{\mathcal{I}}.
$$
For $\theta \in \{\rho, \alpha, \kappa\}$ we model these aggregate observations using a binomial working likelihood
$$
Y^{\hat \theta}_{\mathcal{I}} \sim \text{xBin}(M^{\hat \theta}_{\mathcal{I}}, \theta_{\mathcal{I}}),
$$
where $\theta_{\mathcal{I}}$ are the following weighted aggregates
\begin{align*}
\rho_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} N_i \rho_i}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} N_i}, \\
\alpha_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} N_i \rho_i \alpha_i}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} N_i \rho_i}, \\
\kappa_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} N_i \rho_i \kappa_i}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} N_i \rho_i}.
\end{align*}
We link the proportion recently infected among HIV positive persons $\kappa_i$ to HIV incidence $\lambda_i$ by
$$
\kappa_i = 1- \exp \left( - \lambda \cdot \frac{1 - \rho_i}{\rho_i} \cdot (\Omega_T - \beta_T) - \beta_T \right),
$$
where $\Omega_T$ is the mean duration of recent infection and $\beta_T$ is the false recent ratio.

## ANC testing component

We model HIV prevalence $\rho^\text{ANC}_i$ and ART coverage $\alpha^\text{ANC}_i$ among pregnant women as being offset on the logit scale from the general population indicator as follows
\begin{align*}
\text{logit}(\rho^\text{ANC}_i) &= \text{logit}(\rho_i) + \tilde{\eta}^{\rho^\text{ANC}}_i, \\
\text{logit}(\alpha^\text{ANC}_i) &= \text{logit}(\alpha_i) + \tilde{\eta}^{\rho^\text{ANC}}_i.
\end{align*}

Likelihood section to be written.

## ART attendance component

Let $\gamma_{x, x'} \in [0, 1]$ be the probability that a person on ART residing in district $x$ recieves ART in district $x'$.
Process section to be written.

Let $\dot A_i$ be the number of people receiving ART.

# Fast approximate inference method\label{sec:fastinferencemethods}

Consider a latent Gaussian model (LGM) of the form
\begin{alignat*}{2}
&\text{(Observations)}     &        \y &\sim p(\y \, | \, \x, \btheta), \\
&\text{(Latent field)}     &        \x &\sim \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q}(\btheta)^{-1}), \\
&\text{(Parameters)}       & \qquad \btheta &\sim p(\btheta),
\end{alignat*}
where $\text{dim}(\y) = \text{dim}(\x) = n$ and $\text{dim}(\btheta) = m$, and $m < n$.
The joint posterior of $(\x, \btheta)$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
  p(\x, \btheta \, | \, \y)
  \propto p(\btheta) |\mathbf{Q}(\btheta)|^{n/2} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \x^\top \mathbf{Q}(\btheta) \x + \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \, | \, x_i, \btheta) \right).
\end{equation*}
We consider approximations to the posterior marginals of each latent random variable $x_i$ and parameter $\theta_j$ given by
\begin{align}
  \tilde p(x_i \, | \, \y) \approx p(x_i \, | \, \y) &= \int p(x_i, \btheta \, | \, \y) \text{d} \btheta = \int p(x_i \, | \, \btheta, \y) p(\btheta \, | \, \y) \text{d}\btheta, \quad i = 1, \dots, n, \label{eq:inla1} \\
  \tilde p(\theta_j \, | \, \y) \approx p(\theta_j \, | \, \y) &= \int p(\btheta \, | \, \y) \text{d}\btheta_{-j} \quad j = 1, \ldots, m. \label{eq:inla2}
\end{align}

## Forwards algorithm\label{sec:algorithm}

Given a \textsf{C++} user template `model.cpp` for the negative unnormalised log posterior $- \log p(\y, \x, \btheta)$, we obtain the posterior marginal approximations $\{ \tilde p(x_i \, | \, \y) \}_{i = 1}^n$ and $\tilde p(\theta_j \, | \, \y)_{j = 1}^m$ via the following algorithm, comprised of nested applications of Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

1. Use a Laplace approximation to obtain the unnormalised $\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y)$
$$
\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y) = \frac{p(\y, \x, \btheta)}{\tilde p_\text{G}(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)} \Big\rvert_{\x = \hat \x(\btheta)}
$$
where $\tilde p_\text{G}(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) = \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \hat \x(\btheta), \mathbf{H}(\btheta)^{-1})$ is a Gaussian approximation to $p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)$ with mode and precision matrix given by
\begin{align*}
\hat \x(\btheta) &= \argmin_\x - \log p(\y, \x, \btheta), \\
\mathbf{H}(\btheta) &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial x^\top} - \log p(\y, \x, \btheta) \rvert_{\x = \hat \x(\btheta)}.
\end{align*}

2. Normalise $\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y)$ using adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to obtain
$$
\tilde p_\text{AQ}(\btheta \, | \, \y) = \frac{\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y)}{\tilde p_{\text{AQ}}(\y)},
$$
where the normalising constant is calculated using nodes from a Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule $\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)$ with $m = \dim(\btheta)$, $k$ nodes per dimension, and weights $\omega: \z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k) \to \mathbb{R}$ as
$$
\tilde p_{\text{AQ}}(\y) = \sum_{\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)} \tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta(\z), \y) \omega(\z).
$$
The nodes $\z$ are adapted based on the mode and curvature at the mode of the Laplace approximation as follows
\begin{align*}
\btheta(\z) &= \hat{\btheta} + \mathbf{L} \z, \\
\hat{\btheta} &= \argmax_{\btheta} {\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y)}, \\
\mathbf{H} &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \btheta \partial \btheta^\top} - \log \tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y) \rvert_{\btheta = \hat \btheta} \\
\mathbf{H}^{-1} &= \mathbf{L} \mathbf{L}^\top.
\end{align*}
We typically set $k = 3$ such that there are $3^m$ nodes in total.

3. Obtain an unnormalised nested approximation to the posterior marginal of the $i$th latent effect by
$$
\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \y) = \sum_{\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)} \tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \btheta(\z), \y) \omega(\z).
$$
The nodes and weights $\{\mathcal{Q}(m, k), \omega\}$ used to obtain $\tilde p_{\text{AQ}}(\y)$ are reused to perform integration with respect to the hyperparameters above.
For each of the $k^m$ values of $\btheta(\z)$ we obtain $\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \btheta(\z), \y)$ by setting $\btheta = \btheta(\z)$ in the following Laplace approximation
$$
\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \btheta, \y) = \frac{p(x_i, \x_{-i}, \btheta, \y)}{\tilde p_\text{G}(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)} \Big\rvert_{\x_{-i} = \hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)}
$$
where $\tilde p_\text{G}(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) = \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta), \mathbf{H}_{-i, -i}(x_i, \btheta)^{-1})$ is a Gaussian approximation to $p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)$ with mode and precision matrix given by
\begin{align*}
\hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta) &= \argmin_{\x_{-i}} - \log p(\y, x_i, \x_{-i}, \btheta), \\
\mathbf{H}_{-i, -i}(x_i, \btheta) &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \x_{-i} \partial \x_{-i}^\top} - \log p(\y, x_i, \x_{-i}, \btheta) \rvert_{\x_{-i} = \hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)}.
\end{align*}
Optimisation to obtain $\hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)$ may be initialised at $\hat \x(\btheta)_{-i}$.


4. Normalise $\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \y)$ using $\tilde p_{\text{AQ}}(\y)$ to obtain
$$
\tilde p_\text{AQ}(x_i \, | \, \y) = \frac{\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \y)}{p_{\text{AQ}}(\y)}.
$$
which may be evaluated for some choice of values $x_i \in \{\ldots\}$.


## Backward algorithm\label{sec:algorithm}

1. Calculate
\begin{align*}
\hat{\btheta} &= \argmax_{\btheta} {\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y)}, \\
\mathbf{H} &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \btheta \partial \btheta^\top} - \log \tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y) \rvert_{\btheta = \hat \btheta} \\
\mathbf{H}^{-1} &= \mathbf{L} \mathbf{L}^\top,
\end{align*}
where
$$
\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y) = \frac{p(\y, \x, \btheta)}{\tilde p_\text{G}(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)} \Big\rvert_{\x = \hat \x(\btheta)}
$$
where $\tilde p_\text{G}(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y) = \mathcal{N}(\x \, | \, \hat \x(\btheta), \mathbf{H}(\btheta)^{-1})$ is a Gaussian approximation to $p(\x \, | \, \btheta, \y)$ with mode and precision matrix given by
\begin{align*}
\hat \x(\btheta) &= \argmin_\x - \log p(\y, \x, \btheta), \\
\mathbf{H}(\btheta) &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial x^\top} - \log p(\y, \x, \btheta) \rvert_{\x = \hat \x(\btheta)}.
\end{align*}
2. Generate a set of nodes $\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)$ and weights $\omega: \z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k) \to \mathbb{R}$ from a Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule with $m = \dim(\btheta)$, $k$ nodes per dimension, as follows
\begin{align*}
\btheta(\z) &= \hat{\btheta} + \mathbf{L} \z, \\
\hat{\btheta} &= \argmax_{\btheta} {\tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y)}, \\
\mathbf{H} &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \btheta \partial \btheta^\top} - \log \tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta, \y) \rvert_{\btheta = \hat \btheta} \\
\mathbf{H}^{-1} &= \mathbf{L} \mathbf{L}^\top.
\end{align*}
We typically set $k = 3$ such that there are $3^m$ nodes in total.
3. Use this quadrature rule to calculate $\tilde p_{\text{AQ}}(\y)$ as follows
$$
\tilde p_{\text{AQ}}(\y) = \sum_{\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)} \tilde p_\text{LA}(\btheta(\z), \y) \omega(\z).
$$
4. For $x_i \in \{\ldots\}$ and $\btheta \in \{ \btheta(\z) \}_{\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)}$ calculate the modes and Hessians
\begin{align*}
\hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta) &= \argmin_{\x_{-i}} - \log p(\y, x_i, \x_{-i}, \btheta), \\
\mathbf{H}_{-i, -i}(x_i, \btheta) &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \x_{-i} \partial \x_{-i}^\top} - \log p(\y, x_i, \x_{-i}, \btheta) \rvert_{\x_{-i} = \hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)},
\end{align*}
where optimisation to obtain $\hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)$ may be initialised at $\hat \x(\btheta)_{-i}$.

5. For each $x_i$ calculate
$$
\tilde p_\text{AQ}(x_i \, | \, \y) = \frac{\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \y)}{p_{\text{AQ}}(\y)}.
$$
where
$$
\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \y) = \sum_{\z \in \mathcal{Q}(m, k)} \tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \btheta(\z), \y) \omega(\z).
$$
and
$$
\tilde p_\text{LA}(x_i, \btheta, \y) = \frac{p(x_i, \x_{-i}, \btheta, \y)}{\tilde p_\text{G}(\x_{-i} \, | \, x_i, \btheta, \y)} \Big\rvert_{\x_{-i} = \hat \x_{-i}(x_i, \btheta)}.
$$

# Application to the Naomi model\label{sec:results}

* The \textsc{R} [@r] code used to produce all results we describe is available at `github.com/athowes/elgm-inf`. The inference method is available in versions 0.5.0. onwards of the `aghq` package
* Using the `TMB` template, we fit the model using four inferential approaches: (1) empirical Bayes combined with a Gaussian approximation, (2) AGHQ combined with a Gaussian approximation, (3) AGHQ combined with a Laplace approximation and (4) the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm No-U-Turn Sampling (NUTS). We treat results from NUTS as the gold-standard
* We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the maximum difference between two empirical cumulative distribution functions to compare posterior marginal distributions
* We performed posterior predictive checks to assess the coverage of our estimates via the uniformity of the data within each posterior marginal distribution
