# The Naomi model

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=.65}

* Naomi is a complicated spatio-temporal evidence synthesis model
* Used by countries to produce HIV estimates in a yearly process supported by UNAIDS
* Fast inference is important to allow for interactive review and development of estimates
* Inference for Naomi is currently conducted using Template Model Builder (`TMB`) [@kristensen2016tmb]

# Thanks for listening!

* Working on a paper based on this work called "Fast approximate Bayesian inference for small-area estimation of HIV indicators using the Naomi model" joint with Alex Stringer (Waterloo), Seth Flaxman (Oxford), Jeff Eaton (Imperial)
* Code and notebooks for this project are available at `athowes.github.io/elgm-inf`
